              <h3>Game Development</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We started by having a meeting to discuss what theme of game
                  we wanted to make and what kind of story we wanted to tell.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  We had a meeting while creating a Figma chart together to
                  decide what code our game will need.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  We then went through our Figma chart and decided on changes we
                  could make.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  We then decided on our story and fit it around our Figma
                  chart.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  We then split up our Figma chart into pieces of code that
                  needed to be written and distrubuted it via Trello.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  We then worked on our indivdual parts while talking and
                  helping each other.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Once we had our code written we all went over it together to
                  correct, make changes and error correct our code.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  After all our code was written we imported all our code into
                  one file to be stitched together which was a task that needed
                  all of us.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  When we got the code working we started to error test the full
                  game to see if anything was broken or needed adjustments.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Once we got the game to a place we where happy with, we went
                  through and added flavour text to give our game some life.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  We did our final playthroughs and had friends of ours try the
                  game to get some feedback that lead to some improvements.
                </li>
                <br> 
                <li>
                  With everything working and improvements made, we then
                  proceeded to create this website that you're seeing now.

              <h4 class="mid1">What Went Well</h4>
              <p>
                We had great teamwork, I can't mention that enough, we had great
                communication, amazing planning and a smooth work flow. Our team
                members took and gave critism to each other with no complaints
                and even used it to improve, we where able to quite smoothly
                transition from our own indivual code segments and stitch it
                into a single file using all our own inputs.

              <h4 class="mid2">What We Would Change</h4>
              <p>
                With the knowledge we have now I believe we would be more
                ambitious, we would make the game longer, add in more segments
                that would make the partner choice have a more unique feel, even
                add in more options to choose from, add in more puzzles to the
                game to make it more than just picking options down a path.
